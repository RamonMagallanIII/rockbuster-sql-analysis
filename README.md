# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

## Overview

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a former global movie rental company that is pivoting
to an online video streaming model to stay competitive with services like Netflix and Amazon Prime.
As part of the Business Intelligence (BI) team, this project involved analyzing internal databases to inform

  • How do sales figures vary between different geographic regions?

## Tools Used
  • PostgreSQL for querying the relational database
  • DB Browser for SQLite and pgAdmin for inspection
  • Excel, Powerpoint, and Word for presenting the final results
  • Markdown for project documentation
