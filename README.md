# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project
### SQL-driven business insights for Rockbuster's digital strategy launch

## Overview

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a former global movie rental company that is pivoting
to an online video streaming model to stay competitive with services like Netflix and Amazon Prime.
As part of the Business Intelligence (BI) team, this project involved analyzing internal databases to inform
strategic decisions for the digital product launch.

This repository contains SQL queries and analysis conducted to answer key business questions posed by
Rockbuster's management team. The goal was to extract actionable insights and present them in a
format suitable for both business and technical stakeholders.

## Key Business Questions
The analysis was guided by the following management questions:
  • Which movies contributed the most and least to revenue?
  • What is the average rental duration across all videos?
  • Which countries are Rockbuster customers located in?
  • Where are the customers with the highest lifetime value based?
  • How do sales figures vary between different geographic regions?

## Tools Used
  • PostgreSQL for querying the relational database
  • DB Browser for SQLite and pgAdmin for inspection
  • Excel, Powerpoint, and Word for presenting the final results
  • Markdown for project documentation
